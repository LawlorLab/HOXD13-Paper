# HOXD13-Paper

Processed data and downstream analysis of scRNA Seq experiments for the paper HOXD13 is a direct EWS-FLI1 target and moderates fusion-dependent transcriptional states. This repository includes the R script that will replicate panels from Figure 7 the paper. To process the data you can pull in the matrix files from GEO and run the code. 

Attached files:

1. HOXD13_Paper_data_Analysis.Rmd This R markdown file should allow for complete analysis of the data and reproduction of the figures from the paper. To start you will need to go to the GEO page (GSE) and download the 2 tar.gz files and put them into your wd. Then using the code you should be able to pull them in and run the code.
